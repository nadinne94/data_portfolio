    My background in Civil Engineering has established a solid foundation in solving complex problems, analytical thinking, and mathematical skills. In the engineering field, I excel in team management, leading operations on construction sites, and maintaining direct interactions with suppliers and clients. Managing a semi-jewelry store, I delved into entrepreneurship and digital marketing. These experiences not only provided a comprehensive understanding of diverse scenarios but also enhanced practical skills such as team leadership, problem-solving, and marketing strategies.

    In my journey in the data field, I sought to refine my skills in data processing, cleansing, queries, and exploratory analysis. I gained expertise in database management, SQL language, and various database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. I also developed proficiency in Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda. In Power BI, I not only used it as a Data Viz tool but also for data processing, Power Query, and dashboard creation.
